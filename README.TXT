## Linked Lists

This repository provides Java implementations of four types of linked lists: singly linked list, doubly linked list, circularly linked list, and ordered list. Each type of linked list is described with example code and usage instructions. 

Linked lists are fundamental data structures that offer dynamic storage allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations. Use these implementations as a reference or starting point for your own projects that require linked list functionality.
